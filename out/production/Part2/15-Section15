- Develop code that mitigates security threats such as denial of service, code injection, input validation and ensure data integrity.
- Secure resource access including filesystems, manage policies and execute privileged code.


java.util.Date is mutable API class
java.time.* immutable.


One of the guidelines for protecting objects from mutating unexpectedly is that you should support copy functionality for a class you design.



Which of the following is a recommended practice for providing copy functionality for a mutable class

A.  Provide an accessible static creation method.

B.  Override the clone method and implement it.

C.  Provide an accessible copy constructor.

D.  Implement a public copy method for final classes.

E.  Callers should plan on performing a manual copy.


A,C,D are correct.

--------------------------------------

Which statements are NOT true about serialization and deserialization?

* A.   Serialization provides an interface to classes that sidesteps the field access control mechanisms of the Java language.

* B.   Making a class serializable effectively creates a public interface to all fields of that class.

* C.   Serialization effectively adds a hidden public constructor to a class, which needs to be considered when trying to restrict object construction.

* D.   Deserialization should be designed to behave like normal construction.

* E.   Deserialization creates a new instance of a class without invoking any constructor on that class

* F.   An attacker can serialize an object to bypass a security check and access the internal state simply by reading the serialized byte stream.

all statements are true......
